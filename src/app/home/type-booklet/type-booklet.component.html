                <p>
                    Creating a booklet to showcase the easily recognizable, typeface Bodoni, required research into its history, and the impact
                    it had as one of the first modern typefaces. Understanding its relevance to popular culture and the design world was a necessary foundation
                    to creating a booklet where Bodoni was the star. With few images other than the letterform, this booklet was designed to highlight the unique
                    qualities and beautiful typographic design that went into creating the many variations of this fundamental typeface.

                            I spent most of the research time investigating type studies and viewing different arrangements of the typeface.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                           I created two different compositions of the booklet, each with four different spreads. After gathering critique and feedback on both documents, I revised the layouts and selected the six best spreads to be included in the final design.
                           <br>
                           
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Layout 1</h3>
                        <div class="image-div half-image">
                            <img src="assets/type-booklet/comp-1-1.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/type-booklet/comp-2-1.jpg">
                        </div>
                        <p>I chose the first variation for several reasons. 
                            The vector image of Giambattista Bodoni did not match the design 
                            of the rest of the booklet, and for this reason I chose not to include it. 
                            His name on the page next to the vector image is also too large. I ultimately decided to remove the name from the left page, as it was bolded in the paragraph on the second page.
                        <br><br> 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Layout 2</h3>
                        <div class="image-div half-image">
                            <img src="assets/type-booklet/comp-1-2.jpg">

                        </div>
                        <p>While comparing these two spreads, I decided to move forward with the first variation because I thought the diagonal type was a more interesting use of space. Furthermore, the foundaries on the right side of the second layout felt like an afterthought, and I wanted to feature them elsewhere.
                        <br><br> 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Layout 3</h3>
                        <div class="image-div half-image">
                            <img src="assets/type-booklet/comp-1-3.jpg">

                        </div>
                        <p>Moving forward with these pages, I wanted to make sure the shoe with the alphabet would be bigger and featured in the final composition. I also wanted to add more brands to the showcase to show how prominent Bodoni is in fashion and pop culture.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Layout 4</h3>
                        <div class="image-div half-image">
                            <img src="assets/type-booklet/comp-1-4.jpg">

                        </div>
                        <p>For the final spreads in each of my compositions, I chose to feature the full-page of numbers, rather than hiding them in the triangle. The numbers within the triangle also felt haphazardly thrown together, while the large, in-line layout created a sense of order and let the reader appreciate the letterform. I also decided to remove the type in the middle as it was distracting, and move the numbers closer together.
