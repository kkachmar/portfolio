                    The iconic Tkts booth in the center of Times Square offers tourists, locals, and theater-lovers the opportunity to purchase discounted tickets to shows in New York City. Purchasing same-day Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets at lower prices helps make performances more accessible to the public, increases viewership at shows, and is an exciting way to spend an afternoon or evening in NYC. 
                    <br>
                    We want to digitize the Tkts experience. The unpredictability of the dayâ€™s available tickets, the wait in line, and finally getting to see a Broadway show at an affordable price combine to define the Tkts experience.

                            Users of this app are currently unhappy that it does not offer the ability to search tickets, or see what shows are available. Reviews on the App Store confirm that the intention and purpose of the app needs to be reconsidered.

                            <li>Users can access digital tickets in the app.</li>

                        <p>When creating the information architecture for this app, 
                            I had to consider how the different elements of the site were related 
                            and how they fit in the overall structure of the application.</p>
                        <br>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Once the Information Architecture was created, I was able to construct user flows to demonstrate 
                            how and why a user would navigate through the application. In creating these user flows, 
                            it was important to include not only the different elements users would be interacting with, 
                            but also the questions and choices they would make that would lead them to different parts of the app. 
                            Each user flow began with a goal and demonstrated how the user would navigate through the application to reach their goal.

                            The next step was to begin designing the layout of the app. I began by sketching, then moved on to creating digital wireframes.

                        <h3>Wireframes</h3>

                        <br>

                       <p>Users testing of these wireframes revealed that the ticket purchasing of the app was straightforward to use.
                           It also showed that it would be intuitive for ticket purchases to route to the wallet, to show the active tickets.
                           Changes were integrated into the final app design.
